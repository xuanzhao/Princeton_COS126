Write a program to simulate plucking a guitar string using
the <em>Karplus–Strong</em> algorithm. This algorithm played a seminal
role in the emergence of physically modeled sound synthesis (where
a physical description of a musical instrument is used to synthesize
sound electronically).

</p><p><b>Digital audio.</b>
Before reading this assignment, review the material in the textbook
on digital audio (pp. 155–159, 211–215).


</p><p><b>Simulate the plucking of a guitar string.</b>
When a guitar string is plucked, the string vibrates and creates sound.
The length of the string determines its <em>fundamental frequency</em> of vibration.
We model a guitar string by sampling its <em>displacement</em> (a real
number between –1/2 and +1/2) at <em>n</em>
equally spaced points in time. The integer <em>n</em> equals
the <em>sampling rate</em> (44,100 Hz) divided by the desired fundamental
frequency, rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest integer.

</ul>

<!--
the displacement made in the string moves at the speed of sound
continuously in both directions and then bounces back.

manner.<br>

-->


<p>
<!--
A guitar-player can shorten the vibrating portion of a string by pressing
the string against one of the frets.
The guitar vibrates at a different frequency, depending on this length.
-->


</p><ul>
<li><em>Plucking the string.</em>
The excitation of the string can contain energy at any frequency.
We simulate the excitation with <em>white noise</em>:
set each of the <em>n</em> displacements
to a random real number between –1/2 and +1/2.
<!-- This represents the "initial harmonic transients found in the attack of a real guitar." -->


<p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./COS 126 Programming Assignment_ Plucking a Guitar String_files/white-noise.png" alt="White noise">
</blockquote>
<p>


</p><p></p></li><li><em>The resulting vibrations.</em>
After the string is plucked, the string vibrates.
The pluck causes a displacement that spreads wave-like over time.
The Karplus–Strong algorithm simulates this vibration by maintaining
a <em>ring buffer</em> of the <em>n</em> samples: the algorithm
repeatedly deletes the first sample from the ring buffer 
and adds to the end of the ring buffer the average of the deleted sample and the first sample,
scaled by an <em>energy decay factor</em> of 0.996. For example:


<p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./COS 126 Programming Assignment_ Plucking a Guitar String_files/karplus-strong.png" width="500" alt="the Karplus-Strong update">
</blockquote>
<p>

</p></li></ul>

<p><b>Why it works?</b>
The two primary components that make the Karplus–Strong algorithm
work are the ring buffer feedback mechanism and the averaging operation.

</p><ul>
<li><em>The ring buffer feedback mechanism.</em>
The ring buffer models the medium (a string tied down at both ends)
in which the energy travels back and forth.
The length of the ring buffer determines the fundamental frequency
of the resulting sound.  Sonically, the feedback  
mechanism reinforces only the fundamental frequency and its  
harmonics (frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental).  The  
energy decay factor (0.996 in this case)
models the slight dissipation in energy as the wave makes a  
round trip through the string.

<p></p></li><li><em>The averaging operation.</em>
The averaging operation serves as a gentle <em>low-pass filter</em>
(which removes higher frequencies while allowing lower frequencies to pass).
Because it is in the path of the  
feedback, this has the effect of gradually attenuating the higher  
harmonics while keeping the lower ones, which corresponds closely to
the sound that a guitar string makes when plucked.

</li></ul>

From a mathematical physics viewpoint, the Karplus–Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the transverse motion of the string as a function of time.

<!--
At a high level, the Karplus&ndash;Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the motion of the string as a function of time.
The wave shape spreads out over time.
The vibration gradually eliminates those frequencies introduced by the
pluck that don't match the string's fundamental frequency of the string,
with the higher frequencies decaying faster than the lower ones.
Eventually, the wave shape will be sinusoidal with frequency equal
to the string's fundamental frequency.
The Karplus&ndash;Strong averaging formula is an extremely simplified
method that results in a similar effect, though it remains a bit
of a mystery even to experts.
-->
<!-- The energy decay factor models the friction at the string end points. -->


<p><b>Ring buffer.</b>
Your first task is to create a data type to model the ring buffer.
Write a class named <tt>RingBuffer</tt> that implements the following API:

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<pre><b>public class RingBuffer {</b>
    <b>public         RingBuffer(int capacity)</b>  <font color="gray">//  creates an empty ring buffer with the specified capacity</font>
    <b>public     int capacity()</b>                <font color="gray">//  returns the capacity of this ring buffer</font>
    <b>public     int size()</b>                    <font color="gray">//  returns the number of items currently in this ring buffer</font>
    <b>public boolean isEmpty()</b>                 <font color="gray">//  is this ring buffer empty (size equals zero)?</font>
    <b>public boolean isFull()</b>                  <font color="gray">//  is this ring buffer full (size equals capacity)?</font>
    <b>public    void enqueue(double x)</b>         <font color="gray">//  adds item x to the end of this ring buffer</font>
    <b>public  double dequeue()</b>                 <font color="gray">//  deletes and returns the item at the front of this ring buffer</font>
    <b>public  double peek()</b>                    <font color="gray">//  returns the item at the front of this ring buffer</font>

    <b>public static void main(String[] args)</b>   <font color="gray">//  unit tests the constructor and all methods in this class</font>
<b>}</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><em>Corner cases.</em> Throw a <tt>RuntimeException</tt> with a custom message
if the client calls either <tt>dequeue()</tt> or <tt>peek()</tt> when the ring buffer is empty
or <tt>enqueue()</tt> when the ring buffer is full.


<p></p></li><li><em>Performance requirements.</em> The constructor must take time at most proportional
to the capacity. Every other operation must take constant time.

<p></p></li><li><em>Possible implementation.</em>
Since the ring buffer has a known maximum capacity, you
can implement it using a <tt>double</tt> array of that length.
For efficiency, use <em>cyclic wrap-around</em>: 
maintain one integer instance variable <tt>first</tt> that stores the index
of the least recently inserted item and maintain a second integer instance
variable <tt>last</tt> that stores the index one beyond the most recently
inserted item.
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./COS 126 Programming Assignment_ Plucking a Guitar String_files/ring-buffer.png" width="500" alt="Ring buffer">
</blockquote>


To insert an item, put it at index <tt>last</tt> and increment <tt>last</tt>.
To remove an item, take it from index <tt>first</tt> and increment <tt>first</tt>.
When either index equals <tt>capacity</tt>, make it wrap-around by changing
the index to <tt>0</tt>.
To determine the size of the ring buffer (and whether it is full or empty), you
will also need a third integer instance variable <tt>size</tt>
that stores the number of items currently in the ring buffer.

</li></ul>

<p><b>Guitar string.</b>
Next, create a data type to model a vibrating guitar string.
Write a class named <tt>GuitarString</tt> that implements the following API:
  
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<pre><b>public class GuitarString {</b>
    <b>public         GuitarString(double frequency)</b>  <font color="gray">//  creates a guitar string of the specified frequency, using a sampling rate of 44,100</font>
    <b>public         GuitarString(double[] init)</b>     <font color="gray">//  creates a guitar string whose length and initial values are given by the specified array</font>
    <b>public     int length()</b>                        <font color="gray">//  returns the number of samples in the ring buffer</font>
    <b>public    void pluck()</b>                         <font color="gray">//  plucks this guitar string (by replacing the ring buffer with white noise)</font>
    <b>public    void tic()</b>                           <font color="gray">//  advances the Karplus-Strong simulation one time step</font>
    <b>public  double sample()</b>                        <font color="gray">//  returns the current sample</font>
    
    <b>public static void main(String[] args)</b>         <font color="gray">//  unit tests both constructors and all instance methods in this class</font>
<b>}</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>

<p></p><li><em>Constructors.</em>
There are two ways to create a <tt>GuitarString</tt> object.

<ul>

<p></p><li>
The first constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of the
desired capacity <em>n</em>
(the <em>sampling rate</em> 44,100 divided by the <em>frequency</em>,
rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest integer),
and initializes it to represent a guitar string at rest by enqueueing
<em>n</em> zeros.

<p></p></li><li>
The second constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of capacity equal
to the length <em>n</em> of the array, and initializes the 
contents of the ring buffer to the corresponding values in the array.
In this assignment, this constructor's main purpose is to facilitate testing and debugging.

</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li><em>Length.</em> Return the number of samples <em>n</em> in the <tt>RingBuffer</tt>.

<p></p></li><li><em>Pluck.</em> Replace the <em>n</em> items in the ring buffer with 
<em>n</em> random values between −0.5 and +0.5.
<!-- (Inclusive or exclusive of these endpoints, does not matter.) -->

<p></p></li><li><em>Tic.</em> Apply the Karplus–Strong update: delete the sample at the 
front of the ring buffer and add to the end of the ring buffer the average of the first 
two samples, multiplied by the energy decay factor.

<p></p></li><li><em>Sample.</em> Return the value of the item at the front of the ring buffer.


<!--
<p><li><em>Time.</em> Return the total number of times <tt>tic()</tt> was called on this instance.
-->

</li></ul>


<!--
<p>Again, your test client may contain the tests we give you, 
ones you write yourself, or a combination thereof.
-->


<p><b>Interactive guitar player.</b>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/GuitarHeroLite.java">GuitarHeroLite.java</a>
is a sample <tt>GuitarString</tt> client
that plays the guitar in real time, using the
keyboard to input notes. When the user types the lowercase
letter <tt>'a'</tt> or <tt>'c'</tt>, the program plucks the
corresponding string. Since the combined result of several sound waves
is the <em>superposition</em> of the individual sound waves, it plays the 
sum of the two string samples.

Write a program <tt>GuitarHero</tt> that is similar to <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt>,
but supports a total of 37 notes on the chromatic scale from
110 Hz to 880 Hz. Use the following 37 keys to represent the keyboard,
from lowest note to highest note:

<!--ake the <em>i</em>th character of the string-->

<blockquote><pre>String keyboard = "q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/' ";
</pre></blockquote>

This keyboard arrangement imitates a piano keyboard:
The "white keys" are on the <tt>qwerty</tt> and <tt>zxcv</tt>
rows and the "black keys" on the <tt>12345</tt> and <tt>asdf</tt> rows of the
keyboard.

<p>

<p><br>
<!--The <em>i</em>th character of the string
corresponds to a frequency of 440 &times; 1.05956<sup>(<em>i</em> &minus; 24)</sup>,
so that the character <tt>'q'</tt> is approximately 110 Hz,  <tt>'i'</tt> is close to 220 Hz,
<tt>'v'</tt> is close to 440 Hz, and  <tt>' '</tt> is close to 880 Hz.
(The reason these numbers are not exact has to do with the fact that we are using finite
frequency precision, instead of the theoretical and perfect infinite frequency precision.
We make some adjustments so that our abbreviated computation still results 
in a nice on-pitch sound.)-->

The <em>i</em>th character of the string <tt>keyboard</tt>
corresponds to a frequency of 440 × 2<sup>(<em>i</em> − 24) / 
12</sup>,
so that the character <tt>'q'</tt> is 110 Hz,  <tt>'i'</tt> is 220 Hz,
<tt>'v'</tt> is 440 Hz, and  <tt>' '</tt> is 880 Hz.

Don't even think of including 37 individual <tt>GuitarString</tt> variables
or a 37-way <tt>if</tt> statement!
Instead, create and initialize an array of 37 <tt>GuitarString</tt> objects
and use <tt>keyboard.indexOf(key)</tt> to figure out which key was typed.
Make sure your program does not crash if a keystroke does not 
correspond to one of the 37 possible notes.

and this week's <tt>readme.txt</tt> template.


</p><p>
<b>Submission. </b> &nbsp;
Submit <tt>RingBuffer.java</tt>, <tt>GuitarString.java</tt>, <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>,
and a completed 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/readme.txt">readme.txt</a>.
If your partner is submitting, you should submit a completed

<!------ 
Too many people have StdAudio problems for this one to be fair:
<p><b>Extra credit 1.</b>
Write a program <tt>GuitarHeroVisualizer.java</tt>
(by modifying <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>)
that plots the sound wave in real-time, as the user is playing the
keyboard guitar. The output should look something like this:

<a name='visvideo'></a>
<div style='margin:0px auto'>
<div style='width:620px; margin:0px auto'>
<iframe width="616" height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/W8sp0OkV_o4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</div>

To get credit, your program must 
(1) draw something for every sample, 
(2) run smoothly in real-time with no effects on the audio, and 
(3) run at a minimum of 24 frames per second.
Depending on your computer, you might be able to do 60 FPS or more, 
but this is not required.
Part of what is necessary to accomplish this is
the usage of animation mode as described in the 
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html"
>StdDraw documentation</a>, since deferring the on-screen display until
an entire frame is complete helps make the StdDraw calls fast enough to
not distort
the audio. You can add extra embellishments if you like so long
as your program satisfies 
all three aformentioned requirements.
--->

</p><p><b>Extra credit.</b>
Write a program <tt>AutoGuitar.java</tt> that will <em>automatically</em> play
music using <tt>GuitarString</tt> objects. A few ground rules:

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> We will execute your program with the following command:
<pre>% java-introcs AutoGuitar</pre>

Your program may not accept command-line arguments.
Your program may not use standard input, standard output, or standard drawing.
You may, however, submit an accompanying <tt>.txt</tt> file and read it using
the <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/In.html">In</a> data type.

<p></p></li><li> Your composition must be between 10 and 120 seconds in length. 
Since the sampling rate is 44,100 Hz, this translates to
between 441,000 and 5,292,000 calls to <tt>StdAudio.play()</tt>.
No infinite loops.

<p></p></li><li> Your program must behave consistenly on different machines.
<!--
Use either 
the <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/Stopwatch.html">Stopwatch</a>
data type or 
the fact that approximately 1/44100 of
a second elapses between successive calls to <tt>StdAudio.play()</tt>.
-->

</li></ul>


<p>
You may create chords, repetition, and phrase structure using loops, conditionals,
arrays, and functions. Also, feel free to incorporate randomness.
You may also create a new music instrument by modifying the
Karplus–Strong algorithm; 
consider changing the excitation of the string (from white noise to something
more structured)
or changing the averaging formula (from the average of the first two samples
to a more complicated rule) or anything else you might imagine.
See the checklist for some concrete ideas.



</p><p>
You may submit additional <tt>.java</tt> or <tt>.txt</tt> files to support the extra credit,
(but do not modify <tt>RingBuffer.java</tt>,
<tt>GuitarString.java</tt>, or <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>).
If you are working with a partner, you
can do this part together or solo, but you must decide <em>before</em> you begin.


<!--
<p><b>In-class live concert (optional).</b>
