</p><p><b>What are the main goals of this assignment?</b>
The goals of this assignment are to:
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>Learn about the notorious traveling salesperson problem.
<p></p></li><li>Learn to use linked lists.
<p></p></li><li>Get more practice with data types.
</li></ul>

<p><b>What preparation do I need before beginning this assignment?</b>
Read Section 4.3. Pay particular attention to the parts that deal with
linked lists.

</p><p><b>Can I program with a partner on this assignment?</b>
Yes. You are encouraged (not required) to work with 
a partner provided you practice pair programming.

</p><p><b>Do I need to follow the prescribed API?</b>
Yes, we will be testing the methods in the API directly. If your method has a different 
signature or does not behave as specified, you will lose a substantial number of points.
You may not add public methods to the API; however, you may add private methods 
(which are only accessible in the class in which they are declared).


</p><p>

<td bgcolor="000000">
<font size="+0" face="helvetica" color="ffffff">
<center>Frequently Asked Questions (Tour)</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
<b>What should the various methods do if the tour has no points?</b>
The <tt>size()</tt> method should return 0; the <tt>length()</tt> method
should return 0.0; the <tt>show()</tt> method should print nothing to
standard output; the <tt>draw()</tt> method should draw nothing to standard
drawing.

</p><p>
<b>How do I represent infinity in Java?</b>
Use <tt>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</tt>.


</p><p>
<b>How can I produce an animation of the heuristic in action?</b>
It's easy and instructiveâ€”just redraw the tour after each insertion.
See the instructions in <tt>SmallestInsertion.java</tt>. It could take a
while on a big input file, so you might want to modify it so that it redraws 
only after every 20 insertions or so.
<i>Note</i>: when timing your program, don't show the animation
or else this may become the bottleneck.



</p><p>
<b>What is the file <tt>Tour$Node.class</tt>?</b>
When you declare a <em>nested class</em> like <tt>Node</tt>,
the Java compiler uses the <tt>$</tt> symbol to mark its name.

</p><p><b>How can the suggested definition of <tt>private class Node</tt> work when it has no constructor declared?</b> 
For any class, Java will by default already define a no-argument constructor that sets all
of the instance variables to their default values (here <tt>null</tt> since <tt>Point</tt>
and <tt>Node</tt> are reference types).

</p><p>
<b>What is a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>?</b>
You can get one by initializing a variable of type
<tt>Node</tt>, say <tt>x</tt>, to <tt>null</tt> and then accessing
<tt>x.next</tt> or <tt>x.p</tt>.
This can happen in your insertion routine if you inadvertently
break up the circular linked list.

</p><p>
<b>When should I create a new linked-list node with the keyword <tt>new</tt>?</b>
To create a tour with <em>n</em> points, you should use <tt>new</tt> exactly <em>n</em>
times with <tt>Node</tt>, once per invocation of <tt>insert()</tt>.
It is unnecessary (and bad style) to use <tt>new</tt> with your list traversal
variables since this allocates memory that you never use.

</p><p><b>Running <tt>TSPTimer.java</tt>
with <em>n</em> = 10,000 already takes more than a minute. What should I do?</b>
You have a performance error.
It should take only a few seconds when <em>n</em> is 10,000.
If your code takes much much longer, try to discover why (think
analysis of algorithms), and explain it in your <tt>readme.txt</tt> file.


</p><p><b>When I run <tt>TSPTimer.java</tt> for 10,000 points, my nearest insertion
heuristic runs quickly, but my smallest insertion heuristic takes
more than 10 seconds to run. How can I fix this?</b> 
You probably have a loop that looks at inserting the new point at 
each possible insertion point.  That is fine.  
However, if you are calling the <tt>length()</tt> method to compute 
the new tour length at each potential insertion point, you are 
effectively adding a second loop inside your first loop 
(even though it is a single method call), which is too slow.  
You do not need to recompute the entire tour length for each possible insertion point.
You only need to compute the <em>change</em> in the tour length and keep track of which
insertion point results in the smallest such change.


<!--
<p><b>How can I implement the <tt>toString()</tt> so that it takes linear time
(instead of quadratic time)?</b>
If you use string concatenation, your <tt>toString()</tt> method will likely be to
slow becasue each string concatenation operation takes time linear in the length 
of the output. Instead, use Java's built-in <tt>StringBuffer</tt> data type.
-->

</p><p><b>Can I use Java's built in <tt>LinkedList</tt> class?</b>
Absolutely not! One of the main goals of this assignment is to gain experience
writing and using linked structures. The Java libraries can only take
you so far, and you will quickly discover applications which cannot be solved
without devising your own linked structures.


</p><p>
<b>Do I have to use a linked list for the leaderboard?</b>
No, you are not required to use the <tt>Tour</tt>
data type or linked lists for the leaderboard.
Of course, you should exercise good modular design.

</p><p>
<b>What is the length of the best known tour for tsp1000.txt?</b>
Eric Mitchell '18 holds the COS 126 record with a tour of
length 15566.37.
Using the <a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde.html">Concorde TSP solver</a>,
we found a tour of length 15476.519.

<center>Input, Output, and Testing</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
<b>Input.</b>
&nbsp;
The files for this assignment include many sample inputs.
<!--There are many sample data files (with extension .txt) available from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/">tsp directory</a>.-->
Most are taken from
<a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/index.html">
TSPLIB</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Debugging.</b>
&nbsp;
A good debugging strategy for most programs is to test
your code on inputs that you can easily solve by hand.
Start with 1 and 2 city problems. Then, do a 4 city problem.
Choose the data so that it is easy to work through
the code by hand. Draw pictures.
If your code does not do exactly what your hand calculations
indicate, determine where they differ.
Use the <tt>StdOut.println()</tt> method to trace.


</p><p><b>Checking your work.</b>&nbsp;
For <tt>usa13509.txt</tt> we get tour lengths of <tt>77449.9794</tt>
and <tt>45074.7769</tt>
for nearest insertion and smallest insertion, respectively.
For <tt>circuit1290.txt</tt> we get <tt>25029.7905</tt> 
and <tt>14596.0971</tt>.

<!--
(or <tt> 25091.6899</tt>)
Note that there two possible correct answers with the nearest insertion
heuristic because  after inserting the first 3 points, there are two distinct
tours that have the same length: <tt>A->B->C</tt> and <tt>A->C->B</tt>.
Depending on which one your program chooses, you can end up with a different
tour length (possibly better, possibly worse) down the road.
-->
<!-- With the smallest insertion heuristic, you should get the same exact tour,
just in the opposite order.
-->

</p><p>
<b>Timing.</b>
&nbsp;
You may use the client program <tt>TSPTimer.java</tt> to help you estimate
the running time as a function of the input size <em>n</em>. It takes a
command-line argument <em>n</em>, runs the two heuristics on a random input
of size <em>n</em>, and prints how long each took.


</p><p>
<b>Interactive visualizer.</b>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/TspVisualizer.java">TspVisualizer.java</a>
in an interactive visualizer. It
reads the points from standard input: it displays both the
nearest neighbor heuristic tour (in red) and the
smallest insertion heuristic (in blue).
When you click a point in the window, it will add it to your tour.
You can toggle the visibility o the two tours by typing <tt>n</tt> (for nearest neighbor) or
<tt>s</tt> (for smallest insertion).

If you want to test <tt>Tour.java</tt> afterimplementing only one of the insertion methods,
you must declare the other method (even if it does nothing).</p>

<center>Possible Progress Steps</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>
<p></p><li>Make sure you fully understand the CircularQuote exercise from precept.  This exercise also demonstrates how to use the <tt>do {...} while (...)</tt> loop.
<p></p></li><li>Download the <tt>.zip</tt> file mentioned on the assignment page.
Extract it; later you should save <tt>Tour.java</tt> in the same directory.
<!--The subdirectory <tt>tsp</tt> from the
<a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/">COS 126 ftp site</a>
contains <tt>Point.java</tt> and two client programs, one for 
each heuristic.  There are several small data files for debugging
purposes,
as well as the larger data files that you need for the <tt>readme.txt</tt>
questions.  There is also a client program to help you
do the performance analysis part of the assignment.
The directory also contains <tt>StdIn.java</tt>,
<tt>StdDraw.java</tt>, <tt>StdOut.java</tt> and
this assignment's <tt>readme.txt</tt> file.-->


<p></p></li><li>Study the
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/32class/Point.java.html"><tt>Point</tt></a>
API. Its <tt>main()</tt> method
reads in data from standard input in the TSP input format
and draws the points to standard draw.
In this assignment, you will use <tt>distanceTo()</tt> to compute the distance
between two points and the <tt>drawTo()</tt> method to draw a line segment
connecting two points.

<p></p></li><li>
Create a file <tt>Tour.java</tt>.
Include the standard linked list data type <tt>Node</tt>.
Include one instance variable, say <tt>first</tt>, of type <tt>Node</tt>
that is a reference to the "first" node of the circular linked list.
<!-- 
Here's a <a href = "Tour.java.html">template Tour.java file</a>.
-->

<p></p></li><li>
For debugging purposes only, make a constructor that takes four points as arguments,
and constructs a circular linked list using those four Point objects.
First, create four nodes
and assign one point to each.  Then, link the nodes one to another in a circle.
<!--
<blockquote><pre><font size = "-1">public Tour(Point a, Point b, Point c, Point d) {
    // create four nodes to store the four points
    Node aNode = new Node();
    aNode.p = a;
    Node bNode = new Node();
    bNode.p = b;
    Node cNode = new Node();
    cNode.p = c;
    Node dNode = new Node();
    dNode.p = d;
    
    // link the nodes a to b to c to d to a
    first = aNode;
    aNode.next = bNode;
    bNode.next = cNode;
    cNode.next = dNode;
    dNode.next = first;
  }
</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
-->




<p></p></li><li>Implement the method <tt>show()</tt>.
It should traverse each <tt>Node</tt> in the <em>circular</em> linked list,
starting at <tt>first</tt>, and printing each <tt>Point</tt>
using <tt>StdOut.println()</tt>.
This method requires only a few lines of code, but it is important to think
about it carefully, because debugging 
linked-list code is notoriously difficult and frustrating.
Start by just printing out the first <tt>Point</tt>.
With circular linked-lists the last node on the list points back to the first node,
so watch out for infinite loops.

<p>
Test your method by writing a <tt>main()</tt> function that defines four points,
creates a new <tt>Tour</tt>
object using those four points, and calls its <tt>show()</tt> method.
Below is a suggested four point Tour for  <tt>main()</tt>.  Use it for testing.
<!--
Use the <tt>main()</tt> method given below for testing.  This <tt>main()</tt> defines the 
four points, creates a <tt>Tour</tt> with them, and outputs the <tt>Tour</tt>.
-->
</p><blockquote><pre>  // main method for testing
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // define 4 points forming a square
    Point a = new Point(100.0, 100.0);
    Point b = new Point(500.0, 100.0);
    Point c = new Point(500.0, 500.0);
    Point d = new Point(100.0, 500.0);

    // Set up a Tour with those four points
    // The constructor should link a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d-&gt;a
    Tour squareTour = new Tour(a, b, c, d);

    // Output the Tour
    squareTour.show();
  }
</pre>
</blockquote>



If your method is working properly, you will get
the following output for the 4 city problem above.
<blockquote>
<pre>(100.0, 100.0)
(500.0, 100.0)
(500.0, 500.0)
(100.0, 500.0)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Test your method <tt>show()</tt> on tours with 0, 1 and 2 points to 
check that it still works. You can create such instances by 
modifying the 4-node debugging constructor to only link 0, 1 or 2 of the 
four points to the <tt>Tour</tt>.  (If you don't define <tt>first</tt>, you 
will have an empty <tt>Tour</tt>.  If you define <tt>first</tt> and link it 
back to itself,
you will have a 1 point <tt>Tour</tt>.)  

<p>Put the debugging constructor back to 
the 
original four point <tt>Tour</tt> before continuing.

</p><p></p></li><li>
Implement the method <tt>size()</tt>.
It is very similar to <tt>show()</tt>.
<p>
Test the <tt>size()</tt> method on some sample Tour objects in the <tt>main</tt> method. 
</p><p></p></li><li>
Implement the method <tt>length()</tt>. It is very similar to
<tt>show()</tt>, except that you will need to invoke the method
<tt>distanceTo()</tt> in the <tt>Point</tt> data type.
<p>
Test! Add a call to the <tt>length()</tt> method in the 
<tt>main()</tt> and print the length and size.
The 4-point example has a length of 1600.0.

</p><p></p></li><li>
Implement the method <tt>draw()</tt>. It is also very similar to <tt>show()</tt>,
except that you will need to invoke the method
<tt>drawTo()</tt> in the <tt>Point</tt> data type.
<p>
Test! You will also need to include the statements
</p><blockquote>
<pre> <tt>
StdDraw.setXscale(0, 600);
StdDraw.setYscale(0, 600);
</tt> </pre>
</blockquote>
in your <tt>main()</tt> before you call the <tt>Tour</tt> <tt>draw()</tt> 
method.
The four point example above should produce a square.
</li></ol>


<em>After arriving at this point, you should feel
a sense of accomplishment: working with a linked list is quite difficult at first!</em>

<ol start="8">

<p></p><li>
Implement <tt>insertNearest()</tt>.
To determine which node to insert the point <tt>p</tt> after,
compute the Euclidean distance between each point in the tour and
<tt>p</tt> by traversing the circular linked list.
As you proceed, store the node containing the closest point <em>and</em>
its distance to <tt>p</tt>. After you have found the closest node,
create a node containing <tt>p</tt>, and insert it
<em>after</em> the closest node. This involves changing the <tt>next</tt>
field of both the newly created node and the closest node.
As a check, here is the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/tsp10-nearest.ans">
resulting tour</a> for the 10 city problem which has length 
<tt>1566.1363</tt>.
Note that the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/tsp10-optimal.ans">optimal tour</a>
has length <tt>1552.9612</tt> so this rule does not, in general, yield the
best tour.

<p></p></li><li> After doing the nearest insertion heuristic, you should be able
write the method <tt>insertSmallest()</tt> by yourself, without any hints.
The only difference is that you
want to insert the point <tt>p</tt> where it will result
in the least possible increase in the total tour length.
As a check, here is the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/tsp/tsp10-smallest.ans">
resulting tour</a> which has length <tt>1655.7462</tt>.
In this case, the smallest insertion
heuristic actually does worse than the nearest insertion heuristic
(although this is not typical).
