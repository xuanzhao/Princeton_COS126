</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><b>What are the main goals of this assignment?</b>
Use a symbol table, learn about natural language processing,
and learn about Markov models.

</p><p><b>What preparation do I need before beginning this assignment?</b>
Review the beginning of Section 4.4 (pages 608–617) on using symbol tables
in client code.
For reference, here is a
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/#ST">partial API</a>
of the <tt>ST</tt> data type.
Also review the material on the textbook on parameterized data type 
and generics (pages 566–570).
The <tt>Key</tt> type can be any comparable type, such as
<tt>String</tt> or <tt>Integer</tt>.


</p><p><b>What is the origin of the Markov text generator?</b>
It was first described by Claude Shannon in 1948.
The first computer version was apparently written by Don P.
Mitchell, adapted by Bruce Ellis, and popularized by 
A. K. Dewdney in the <em>Computing Recreations</em>
section of Scientific American.
Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike revived the program in a
University setting and described it as an example of design
in <em>The Practice of Programming</em>.
The program is also described in
Jon Bentley's <em>Programming Pearls</em>.


</p><p><b>Do I have to implement the prescribed API?</b>
Yes, or you will lose a substantial number of points.

</p><p><b>My program won't compile because the compiler can't find the symbol "ST." How can I fix that?</b>
The <tt>ST</tt> data type is not part of Java or <tt>stdlib.jar</tt>. You need to download
<tt>ST.java</tt>&amp;mdashit's part of <tt>markov.zip</tt>—and put it in the same directory
as <tt>MarkovModel.java</tt>.

</p><p><b>I want to refer to the magic number 128 in more than one method. Any advice?</b>
You can define a global constant, as follows:

</p><blockquote><pre>private static final int ASCII = 128;
</pre></blockquote>

This code should appear inside the class block, but before any instance variables or methods.
By convention, constant variable names should be <tt>ALL_UPPERCASE</tt>.
The <tt>static</tt> modifier means that every instance method will refer to the same
variable (as opposed to instance variables, for which there is one variable per object);
the <tt>final</tt> modifier means that you can't change its value, once initialized.

<!--
Your static <em>constants</em> must be initialized immediately (and never modified).
They must not be read in from standard input or the command-line.
-->

<p>
<b>How do I extract a substring of a given string?</b>
The method call <tt>s.substring(i, i+k)</tt> returns the the <tt>k</tt>-character substring
of <tt>s</tt>, starting at <tt>i</tt>. Note that it includes the left endpoint
but excludes the right endpoint.

</p><p><b>How do I emulate the behavior of a circular string?</b>
There are a number of approaches. One way is to
append the first <em>k</em> characters of the input text to the input text.

</p><p><b>How do I convert a <tt>char</tt> to an <tt>int</tt>?</b>
A <tt>char</tt> is a 16-bit (unsigned) integer. Java will automatically
promote a <tt>char</tt> to an <tt>int</tt> if you use it as an index
into an array.

</p><p><b>How do I use <tt>StdRandom.discrete()</tt>?</b>
There are two overloaded methods named <tt>StdRandom.discrete()</tt>.
One takes a floating-point array <tt>p[]</tt> and returns index <tt>i</tt> with probability 
equal to <tt>p[i]</tt>. (The array entries must be nonnegative and sum to 1.)
The other takes an integer array <tt>freq[]</tt> and returns index <tt>i</tt>
with probability proportional to <tt>freq[i]</tt>.
(The array entries must be nonnegative and not all zero.)


<!--
<p><b>My <tt>random()</tt> method calls <tt>StdRandom.discrete()</tt> 
but I get an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>.  What does that mean?</b>
It means that the probabilities don't sum up to 1.  Double check how you
are computing the values for the array you send to <tt>StdRandom.discrete()</tt>.
The array elements are the probabilities of each possible event, so the
sum of the array elements should be 1.
(To learn how to use assertions, see pp. 446-447.)
-->


<!--
<p><b>What is a <tt>StringBuilder</tt> object?</b> <tt>StringBuilder</tt> 
is part of the standard Java library.  It is an object that we use because
of its more efficient handling of large strings &mdash; we saw 
<a href="../precepts/Repeat.pdf">earlier</a> that repeatedly concatenating
characters to a <tt>String</tt> takes quadratic time, whereas this takes linear
time for a <tt>StringBuilder</tt>.  Here is a subset of the
<tt>StringBuilder</tt> API with some methods you might find useful for this 
assignment. You do not need to use all of them.
<blockquote><pre>
public class StringBuilder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              StringBuilder(String s) // create a StringBuilder initialized to the contents of String s
StringBuilder append(char c)          // append the string representation of the char to this sequence
String        toString()              // returns a String representing the data in this sequence
String        substring(int i, int j) // returns the length (j-i) substring including position i, 
                                      // up to and excluding position j (like String.substring())

</pre></blockquote>

<center>Frequently Asked Questions (TextGenerator)</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>


</p><p><b>Should my program generate a different output each time I run it?</b>
Yes.

</p><p><b>How can I read in the input text from standard input?</b>
Use <tt>StdIn.readAll()</tt>. Do not remove whitespace.

</p><p>
<b>My random text ends in the middle of a sentence. Is that OK?</b>
Yes, that's to be expected.

</p><p><b>For which values of <i>k</i> should my program work?</b>
It should work for all well defined values of <em>k</em>, from
0 up to, and including, the length of the input text.
As <em>k</em> gets larger,
your program will use more memory and take longer.

</p><p><b>My program is slow when <tt>T</tt> is large because I am concatenating
the <tt>T</tt> characters, one at a time, to form string of length <tt>T</tt>.
What else can I do?</b>
Do you need to form the entire string? Why not print the characters, one at a time,
as you generate them?
<!--
(When necessary, you should use the <a href = "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html">StringBuilder</a>
data type for this kind of string concatenation.)
-->


</p><p><b>I get an <tt>OutOfMemoryException</tt>. 
How do I tell Java to use more of my computer's memory?</b>
Depending on your operating system, you may have to ask the Java Virtual
Machine for more main memory beyond the default.
</p><pre><blockquote>% <b>java-introcs -Xmx500m TextGenerator 7 1000 &lt; input.txt</b>
</blockquote></pre>
The <tt>500m</tt> means 500MB, and you should adjust this number
depending on the size of the input text.



<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr align="left">
<td bgcolor="000000">
<font size="+0" face="helvetica" color="ffffff">
<center>Testing (MarkovModel)</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p> 
Thoroughly test your <tt>MarkovModel</tt>. We provide a <tt>main()</tt>
as a start to your testing.
</p><blockquote><pre>    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text1 = "banana";
        MarkovModel model1 = new MarkovModel(text1, 2);
        StdOut.println("freq(\"an\", 'a')    = " + model1.freq("an", 'a'));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"na\", 'b')    = " + model1.freq("na", 'b'));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"na\", 'a')    = " + model1.freq("na", 'a'));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"na\")         = " + model1.freq("na"));
        StdOut.println();

        String text2 = "one fish two fish red fish blue fish"; 
        MarkovModel model2 = new MarkovModel(text2, 4);
        StdOut.println("freq(\"ish \", 'r') = " + model2.freq("ish ", 'r'));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"ish \", 'x') = " + model2.freq("ish ", 'x'));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"ish \")      = " + model2.freq("ish "));
        StdOut.println("freq(\"tuna\")      = " + model2.freq("tuna"));
    }
</pre></blockquote>
If your method is working properly, you will get the following output:
<blockquote><pre>% <b>java-introcs MarkovModel</b>
freq("an", 'a')    = 2
freq("na", 'b')    = 1
freq("na", 'a')    = 0
freq("na")         = 2

freq("ish ", 'r') = 1
freq("ish ", 'x') = 0
freq("ish ")      = 3
freq("tuna")      = 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p> To test <tt>random()</tt>,
write a loop that calls <tt>random()</tt> repeatedly, and
count how many times a particular character is returned.
For example, with <tt>model1</tt> above, <tt>random("na")</tt> should return
<tt>'b'</tt> about one-half of the time;
with <tt>model2</tt> above, <tt>random("fish")</tt> should return <tt>'o'</tt>
about one-quarter of the time.

Be sure to test <tt>TextGenerator</tt> with different values of <tt>k</tt>.

An order-0 Markov model generates a random sequence of letters where
each letter appears with probability proportional to its frequency in the
input text. For 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/markov/input17.txt">input17.txt</a>
there are 9 g's, 7 a's, and 1 c.
So we want the probability of generating a <tt>'g'</tt> to be 9/17,
an <tt>'a'</tt> to be 7/17, and a <tt>'c'</tt> to be be 1/17.
In a sequence of 100
characters, we'd therefore expect on average about 53 g's, 41 a's, and 6 c's.

<blockquote><pre>% <b>java-introcs TextGenerator 0 100 &lt; input17.txt</b>
gaaagaacagcagacgacggaagaaggaggaaaaggaggggaggggggaggaggaagggagaaaggagacagcggaggggacgggaggagaggaggagag
</pre></blockquote>

<p></p></li><li>
As documented in the assignment specification, in an order 2 model for
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/markov/input17.txt">input17.txt</a>,
the next character after <tt>"ga"</tt> is <tt>'a'</tt> with probability 1/5 and
<tt>'g'</tt> with probability 4/5.  So, if you run the following command 10 times,
you should expect (on average)
to see <tt>"gag"</tt> approximately 8 times and <tt>"gaa"</tt> approximately 2 times.

<blockquote><pre>% <b>java-introcs TextGenerator 2 3 &lt; input17.txt</b>

<center>Possible Progress Steps (MarkovModel)</center>

</p><p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>
<p></p><li> Download and unzip <tt>markov.zip</tt>.
Make sure that <tt>ST.java</tt> and the  testing <tt>.txt</tt> files
are in the same directory as the <tt>.java</tt> files you are writing. 

<p></p></li><li>
Review the material in the textbook on symbol tables as well as
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/42sort/IntegerSort.java.html">IntegerSort.java</a>.

<p></p></li><li> Create one or more instance variables to support the two <tt>freq()</tt> methods.
One strategy is to maintain two symbol tables—one for the
one-argument <tt>freq()</tt> method and one for the two-argument <tt>freq()</tt> method.
For each <em>k</em>-gram (a string), the first symbol table tells you how many times
it appears in the text (an integer).
For each <em>k</em>-gram (a string), the second symbol table tells you how many times
each ASCII character succeeds the <em>k</em>-gram in the text (an array of 128 integers).

<!--

<p><li> An alternative strategy is to maintain a single symbol to support both <tt>freq()</tt>
methods.
For each <em>k</em>-gram (a string), the symbol table stores another symbol table.
For each character (a character), the symbol table associated with a given <em>k</em>-gram tells you 
how many times that character succeeds the <em>k</em>-gram in the text (an integer).
In this approach, you will have  one symbol table for each <em>k</em>-gram!
</ul>
-->


<p></p></li><li> Write the constructor to create the <em>circular</em> version of the
input text. Then initialize and populate your symbol tables,
using the symbol-table methods <tt>contains()</tt>, <tt>get()</tt>,
and <tt>put()</tt>. This will be a substantial amount of code, relative to the 
other methods in this class.

<p>
Do not save the original text (or the circular text) as an 
instance variable because no instance method will
need this information after the symbol table is initialized.


</p><p></p></li><li> <em>Optional</em>:
Test your constructor by printing the non-zero frequency for each character
for each <em>k</em>-gram entry in your symbol table.
This can help you debug <em>small</em> test cases.
Use the enhanced for loop to access each key–value pair in your symbol table:
<pre>   // st is the symbol table object 
   for (String key : st) {
       StdOut.print (key + ": ")
       ... value = st.get(key);

       // print non-zero frequency for each character in the entry
       ...
   }
</pre>

  You can implement your test code by either:
<ul>
  <li> defining a private "helper" method that you invoke from the <tt>main()</tt> in
       <tt>MarkovModel</tt>, or
  </li><li> accessing <tt>MarkovModel</tt>'s private instance variables from the the <tt>main()</tt>
       in <tt>MarkovModel</tt>.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><pre>Sample output 1 for model1:
ab: 1
an: 2
ba: 1
na: 2

Sample output 2 for model1:
ab: (a, 1)
an: (a, 2)
ba: (n, 1)
na: (b, 1) (n, 1)
</pre>

<p></p></li><li> Write the <tt>order()</tt> method. This should be a one-liner.

<p></p></li><li> Using the symbol table instance variables, write the two 
<tt>freq()</tt> methods.

<p></p></li><li> Use the <tt>main()</tt> provided above to test your code before continuing.
You may wish to add more testing of the constructor and <tt>freq()</tt> methods.

<p></p></li><li> Write the <tt>random()</tt> method. 
To generate a random character with probability proportional to its frequency 
you may call either of the two
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdRandom.html#discrete(double[])">StdRandom.discrete()</a>
methods.

<p></p></li><li> It may not be obvious from your final results whether <tt>random()</tt> is
working as intended, so be sure to test it thoroughly.
Next, test your complete <tt>MarkovModel</tt> data type before continuing.

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>

<p></p><li> Read in <em>k</em> and <em>T</em> from the command line; read the input
text from standard input.

<p></p></li><li> Create a <tt>MarkovModel</tt> object of order <tt>k</tt>
using the input text.

<p></p></li><li> To generate a trajectory of length <em>T</em>, use the
first <em>k</em> characters in the input text as the initial <em>k</em>-gram
and print the initial <em>k</em>-gram.
Then, repeatedly generate and print a new random character according
to the Markov model and update the <em>k</em>-gram to store the last <em>k</em>
characters printed.


<p></p></li><li>Make sure to test your program on large inputs (we provide several),
large outputs, and different values of <tt>k</tt>.
<!--
If the order and input size are fixed, your program should run in time
that is linear in the output size. If the order and output size are fixed,
your program should run in time that is linear in the input size.

Here's a website that 
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/">generate
pseudo-random computer science papers</a>. It uses something
called a <em>context free grammar</em> instead of a 
Markov chain, but otherwise is similar in spirit to what
you are doing on this assignment.

Here are <a href="http://joshmillard.com/garkov/">

What else can I do with a random text generator?
One former COS 126 student recited its output during the
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/10/princeton.filibuster/index.html">Frist filibuster</a>.

<p></p></li><li>We are implementing the model Shannon described in his landmark paper. 
But the "one reads until this letter is encountered" method
in his quote on the assignment page is, ironically,
not a statistically accurate 
example of his model. If we run your program with input
<tt>"wawawaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawy"</tt> then <tt>'w'</tt> should be followed by <tt>'a'</tt> 75% of the time, 
while the "read until" model will follow <tt>'w'</tt> with <tt>'a'</tt> only 15% of the time. What would
be involved in simulating this other model? Which one do you think gives more realistic text?
